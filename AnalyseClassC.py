This Class starts the Analysis. First it retrieves the name of the Original C File and the Decomlied C File
From the Path, provied by the User, then it creates a shared libraray from the Decompiled File, which can be accessed with
Ctyped.

Functions takes the path to a C file as Argument and compiles it to a .so Libary, for using it in Python, with the ctypes lib
Returns the Name of the .so File
